# Idea: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Retail Sales Data
 ## Description:
 In this project, I worked with a dataset containing information about retail sales. The goal is
 to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns, trends, and insights that can
 help the retail business make informed decisions

 ## Key Concepts and Challenges:
 Data Loading and Cleaning: Load the retail sales dataset. 
 
 Descriptive Statistics: Calculate basic statistics (mean, median, mode, standard deviation). 
 
 Time Series Analysis: Analyze sales trends over time using time series techniques. 
 
 Customer and Product Analysis: Analyze customer demographics and purchasing behavior. 
 
 Visualization: Present insights through bar charts, line plots, and heatmaps. 
 
 Recommendations: Provide actionable recommendations based on the EDA

 ## Key Findings
 Total Sales - 456000
 
 Males - 490
 
 Females - 510

 ## Key Visualizations
 A line chart showing the sales trend overtime and we can clearly see the seasonality in trend in different months with mid-year gaving the highest sales.
 
 A bar chart showing the gender distribution with female taking the highest number of 510 customers.
 
 A histogram showing the age distribution of customers. Customers are almost evenly distributed across all ages.
 
 A horizontal bar chart showing the most purchased product category with clothing being the highest. Makes sense since clothing is a basic need and ought to be purchased 
 more.
 
 A bar chart showing product category by revenue. Electronics yields more revenue because they tend to be more expensive.
 
 A heatmap showing distribution of revenue monthly with most being between 0-2000 dollars.
